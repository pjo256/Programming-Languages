To compile this Ada program, run gnatmake main.adb. 

The resulting executable takes in input through I/O redirection. To run a test case, write

./main < input_file (or main if . is in your PATH variable)

Read in 30 numbers into an array. Each number is an integer between 0 and 1000.
There are three tasks, printer, sorter and adder, that run in parallel. These tasks perform the following actions:

Printer:
First print out the elements of the array.
Notify sorter that the numbers have been printed.
Wait for notification from sorter that it is finished.
Print out the elements of the array again.
Wait to receive a value from adder
Print the value received from adder

Adder:
Wait for notification that sorter is finished.
Compute the sum of the elements of the sorted array.
Send the result to printer.

Sorter:
Wait for notification that printer has printed the elements of the array.
Sort the array according to the parallel quicksort algorithm.
Notify both printer and adder that the array is sorted.
