Grab libtcod

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jice/libtcod
cd libtcod
hg checkout 1.5.1 	//tcod-rs tested on libtcod 1.5.1
make -f makefiles/makefile-linux64 clean all


cd path/dwemthys
cargo build
cargo run


---

If this happens:

Running `target/dwemthys`
target/dwemthys: error while loading shared libraries: libtcod.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
An unknown error occurred

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.

Directories for dynamic libraries can be found by running:

cat /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf

Should give you a list of locations. 

cd into the parent directory /usr/lib, and scroll down to find libraries. You should be able to find libtcod.so in this dir, but Cargo is complaining about libtcod.so.1

Make a symbolic link in this dir to the libtcod.so from your libtcod dir. 

Head back to our game, and the problem should be fixed.
